* Org-mode D&D 5e Character Template
Flexible Character Sheet with auto-updating stats, spell descriptions, and pretty
latex export. See the template pdf to get an idea of what the exported form looks like.

Warning: I havn't tested this outside of my personal setup.
* Requirements
** Org With Babel
Functions for updating tables (as well as some fixes for our use of
[[https://github.com/xeals/emacs-org-dnd][emacs-org-dnd]]) are defined in an elisp babel block.

The spell descriptions are generated in a python babel block using the json file
from [[https://github.com/vorpalhex/srd_spells][srd_spells]] (included as a git submodule).

The [[https://github.com/plexus/a.el][a.el]] and [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][s.el]] libraries are also required.

Clearly org, babel, and python must all be configured appropriately.
** PDF Export
Needs [[https://github.com/evanbergeron/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template][Dnd-5e-Latex-Template]] and [[https://github.com/xeals/emacs-org-dnd][emacs-org-dnd]] configured and working.
* Usage
In each section there is a header 'Instructions' which is not exported to the
pdf. Under this header are instructions on how to use the parts of that section
(what will update automatically and what must be filled in manually).

Be sure to run the function definition SRC block when opening the file.

Export to pdf using ox-dnd (C-c C-e l d).
